I'm a second year M.Sc. student of College of Computer Science and Technology/College of Artificial Intelligence in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Software Engineering in June 2015 from Nanjing Xiaozhuang University. 
Currently, my research direction is computer vision, especially object detection.
