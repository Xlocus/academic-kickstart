The development of the public transportation industry has produced a huge amount of diversified public transportation IC card swipe data. In the current era of big data, the application of these data is particularly important. Through the analysis of the bus IC card swiping data, the passengerâ€™s riding behavior can be effectively predicted, and the bus company can provide a basis for optimizing routes. At the same time, through the OD analysis of passengers, we can further understand the travel patterns of urban residents, so as to provide more references for urban planning.
