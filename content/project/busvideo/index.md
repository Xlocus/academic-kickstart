The surveillance video in the bus has the characteristics of simple acquisition and long timeliness. By counting the number of people at different moments in the video, you can quickly understand the comfort level in the car, so that the bus company can optimize the vehicle scheduling strategy. In addition, with the introduction of smart cities and smart buses, helping passengers on platforms and other buses to obtain real-time status in the vehicle can facilitate passengers to adjust their travel mode as needed, and counting the number of people in the bus can be used as a powerful support for this purpose.
