When a Vessel is sailing, it will be affected and interfered by various factors and cause navigation errors, so the trajectory is generally not a straight line. The line of adjacent estimated vessel positions is often called the estimated trajectory, and the line of adjacent observed ship positions is called the actual trajectory. By analyzing the trajectory, different purposes of the ship can be obtained to prepare for the predicted trajectory.
